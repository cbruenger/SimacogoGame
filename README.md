A java implementation of a game called Simacogo, which has a playing style similar to Connect-4, but with different means of scoring. Scores accumulate for the user and the AI agent according to the positioning of the pieces in the board. 2 points are added for same-type pieces that are directly above/below or side-by-side, and 1 point is added for same-type pieces that are diagonal.

This project was completed for the purpose of implementing a multi agent game between a user and and AI agent, in which the AI agent implements the Mini-Max algorithm to choose its next move.
